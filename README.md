# pancreatic-scripts
Various scripts for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma research

**_utility**: originally _scripts/_utility, contains various utility scripts for SPARK gene analysis, data processing, and other generic simulations

**pvalues**: originally GSE111672/ST/tsv/pvalues, processing and divvying up the adjusted p-value results from the GSE111672 data

**significant**: originally GSE111672/ST/tsv/significant, contains original significant p-value data that are then better presented in pvalues

**plotting**: new plotting scripts trying to manually annotate PDAC-A and PDAC-B data, as well as re-formatting and cleaning to present as model input

**matlab**: matlab-based analysis using the COBRA toolbox for gene analysis and mCADRE for model creation and analysis
